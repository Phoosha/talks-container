# Demo material for a Containers talk

This repository contains all the materials for a demonstration alongside a talk
about containers. It consists of:
- a demo application in [`pickyapp`](./pickyapp) and
- a guided tour consisting of 3 stages
    - [`01_motivation`](./01_motivation)
    - [`02_dockerfile`](./02_dockerfile)
    - [`03_advanced`](./03_advanced)


## Usage

1. Take a look at the source code of the demo application, which essentially
   just serves a dynamically resized static image.
2. Open a shell in one of the guided tour directories and follow the
   instructions from the that directories README.
